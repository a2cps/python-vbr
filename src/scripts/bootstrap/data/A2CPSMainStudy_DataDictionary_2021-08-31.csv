Examples of physical activity intensity levels:

Light activities
•	Your heart beats slightly faster than normal
•	You can talk and sing
Examples; walking leisurely, stretching, vacuuming or light yard work

Moderate activities
•	Your heart beats faster than normal
•	You can talk but not sing
Examples; fast walking, aerobics class, strength training, swimming gently

Vigorous activities
